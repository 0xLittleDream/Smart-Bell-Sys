How to Use
1. Power & Boot

Power the ESP32 using a USB cable or a regulated 5V supply.

On boot, the ESP32 starts in Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) mode.

2. Connect to the ESP32

Open Wi-Fi settings on your phone or laptop.

Connect to the Wi-Fi network created by the ESP32 (example: ESP_BELL).

No internet is required.

3. Open the Control Panel

Open any web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).

Go to the following address:

http://192.168.4.1


This opens the Smart Bell Control Panel.

4. Create & Manage Bell Presets

On the homepage, you can:

Add new bell presets (e.g., Regular Day, Exam Day).

Open a preset to configure bell timings.

Inside a preset:

Add bells sequentially (1st Bell, 2nd Bell, etc.).

Set each bell time using a 24-hour clock.

Save the preset.

5. Real-Time Operation

The current time is shown live on:

The web interface

The OLED display connected to the ESP32

When the RTC time matches a configured bell time:

The ESP32 triggers the relay

6. Power Failure Safety

Timekeeping is maintained by the DS3231 RTC (battery-backed).

Bell schedules are stored in non-volatile memory.

After power restoration, the system resumes automatically without reconfiguration.
